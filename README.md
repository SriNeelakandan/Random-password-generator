# 🔐 Random Password Generator

This is a simple Python project that generates a secure and random password based on user preferences.
The program allows users to specify the desired length of the password and the number of letters, symbols, and digits to include.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - Number of letters (A-Z, a-z)
   - Number of symbols (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
   - Number of numbers (0–9)

2. The program uses Python's built-in random module to:
   - Randomly select characters from predefined lists of letters, numbers, and symbols
   - Combine and shuffle them to generate a secure password

3. Finally, the generated password is displayed to the user.
